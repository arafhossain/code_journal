Began my first dive into the Angular ecosystem. Have been a React user and was trying to understand the use cases of React vs Angular in different scenarios. Angular has a lot more setup per component and all these new keywords and concepts of Selectors, Directives, Injectors etc have convinced me that although Angular may have a steeper learning curve, it's highly configurable and easier to control the direction that data is passed around and how functions can very specifically influence an application. Two way data binding is super cool and simple to interact with on the surface!
